"""spar.py — practise against the bots. Zero key, unlimited, outside the arena budget.

    python spar.py --bot rookie --as all
    python spar.py --bot operator --as defender
    python spar.py --bot adversary --as prosecutor --rounds 10 --seed 3
    python spar.py --bot operator --ui          # watch it in the pixel arena

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It runs the REAL kit machinery: the real MCP/A2A servers over the real 12,375-page
world, the real mutation engine, the real referee (`kit/referee/`, hash-synced from
the arena's — CONTRACTS.md 2.4), and the real trusted envelope, so your
`Gateway.decide` is called exactly the way the arena calls it.

Two honest differences from a scored duel, both structural:

  * **The model is `MockBroker`.** Deterministic scripted personas, no key, no network.
    Your gateway sees the same Commands; the reasoning behind them is canned.
  * **The eight semantic classes come back `pending`.** The kit has no model, so gate 2
    cannot run locally (see `kit/referee/adjudicate.py`). The NINE DETERMINISTIC
    CLASSES — including both weight-10s — resolve here exactly as they will in the
    arena. Build those detectors first; they are the ones you can be certain about.

THE PART THAT ACTUALLY TEACHES YOU SOMETHING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read the MISSED list in the post-match report, not the HP.

HP tells you what your opponent managed to prove. The missed list tells you what the
referee mechanically DETECTED in your opponent's trace that your prosecutor never
argued — free damage you walked past. `no claim, no damage` cuts both ways, and this
is the only place you get to see the other side of it.
